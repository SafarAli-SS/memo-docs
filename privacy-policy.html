    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for using Memo! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.

1. Data Collection and Usage
Local Storage: All your notes, tasks, reminders, and extracted text from images are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, process, or store any of your data on external servers.
Internet Usage: The app requires an internet connection for:
Loading Google Fonts online.
Downloading language files for the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature.
No Account Required: Memo does not require an account or login.
2. Permissions
Memo may request the following permissions:

Notification Access: To send reminders for your notes, tasks, and special days.
Storage Access: To save extracted text as notes and potentially export or back up your data.
Camera and Photos (if applicable): To allow OCR functionality for extracting text from images.
3. Third-Party Services
Google Fonts: Used for rendering text styles within the app. Fonts are loaded from Googleâ€™s servers when needed.
OCR Language Files: Downloaded from the internet to enable text recognition.
Memo does not share your data with third-party services. However, if you use the "Share" feature, the selected app/platform may process your data according to its privacy policy.

4. Your Rights
Since all your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can delete or manage your data directly from your device.
